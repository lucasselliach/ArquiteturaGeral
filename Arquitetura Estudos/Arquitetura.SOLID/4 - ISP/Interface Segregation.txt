S.O.L.I.D is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design(OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin, popularly known as Uncle Bob.

These principles, when combined together, make it easy for a programmer to develop software that are easy to maintain and extend. 
They also make it easy for developers to avoid code smells, easily refactor code, and are also a part of the agile or adaptive 
software development.

S.O.L.I.D STANDS FOR:

When expanded the acronyms might seem complicated, but they are pretty simple to grasp.

S – Single-responsiblity principle
O – Open-closed principle
L – Liskov substitution principle
I – Interface segregation principle
D – Dependency Inversion Principle




Interface segregation principle

A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on 
methods they do not use.
