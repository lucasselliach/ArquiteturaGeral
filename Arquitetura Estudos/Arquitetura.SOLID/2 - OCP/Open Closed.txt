S.O.L.I.D is an acronym for the first five object-oriented design(OOD) principles by Robert C. Martin, popularly known as Uncle Bob.

These principles, when combined together, make it easy for a programmer to develop software that are easy to maintain and extend. 
They also make it easy for developers to avoid code smells, easily refactor code, and are also a part of the agile or adaptive 
software development.
